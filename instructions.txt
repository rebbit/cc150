1. first create a repo on github, for example cc150
2. on local machine, you can first use "git init" to initialize the repo
3. then "git pull https://github.com/rebbit/cc150.git" to sync with the remote server (this needs your account & passwd on github"
4. run "git push", you should be able to connect your local reposotory to your github repository now.
5. have fun!
